# pyats-ios-sample
Hereâ€™s a full test script in pyATS with local libraries that connects to a
testbed of IOS devices, and runs various test cases that parses command outputs,
collects router information, and report them in log.

Arguments:
    This script requires one script argument (testbed) to be passed in when run
    under standalone execution for demonstration purposes.
    testbed: the path to testbed yaml file

    This script requires one script argument (testbed_file) and two optional
    script argument (ios1 and ios2) to be passed in when run under easypy for
    demonstration purposes.
    testbed_file: the path to testbed yaml file
    ios1: the device name defined in the testbed yaml file, if modified
    ios2: the device name defined in the testbed yaml file, if modified

Topology:

    +-------------+          Eth0/0 <-> Eth0/0           +-------------+
    |             | ------------------------------------ |             |
    |    ios1     |                                      |    ios2     |
    |             | ------------------------------------ |             |
    +-------------+          Eth0/1 <-> Eth0/1           +-------------+

Testing:
    This script performs the following tests for demonstration purposes.

    - router connection: basic device connection test

    - `ping` command: basic device ping test; logs ping result.

    - interface count verification

        - execute `show version` command: basic command execution and data
                                          parsing; extract ethernet and serial
                                          interface counts; logs interface
                                          counts.

        - execute `show ip interface brief` command: basic command execution and
                                                     data parsing; extract all
                                                     ethernet and serial
                                                     interfaces; logs number of
                                                     interface counts.

        - verify ethernet and serial interface counts from above commands.

    - router disconnect: basic device disconnect test

Examples:
    # to run under standalone execution
    bash$ python pyats_ios_example.py --testbed pyats_ios_example.yaml

    # to run under easypy
    bash$ easypy pyats_ios_example_job.py -testbed_file pyats_ios_example.yaml
